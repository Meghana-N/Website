                    of the founder, the paramount support of the vice principal and the 
                    untiring efforts of the faculty has led the school to achieve the peak of 
                    distinction that it is today with a community of students over 3000 which 
                    is an overwhelming response to the achievements and laurels brought to the 
                    school by toil and utmost dedication of the managing trustee ,teachers and 
                    the best efforts of the students.

                    to make the school counted among the best schools in the area.
                    Through the divine intervention and the collective toil of the 
                    teachers and students, the school is accorded the spectacular 
                    tradition of consistently maintaining the peak of fame of getting 
                    100% results, since the first batch within distinction status.
                </p>
